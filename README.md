# E-commerce Back-end

## Description:

For this project I was given a working express.js server, and tasked with creating the database and API routes to make it work properly. It usesnode, express, dotenv, sequelize, and mysql. It is a working exapmle of a simple e-commerce style back-end. You can view, add, update, and remove products, categories, tags, and relationships between them.
